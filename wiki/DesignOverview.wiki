= !BioScholar Design =

!BioScholar is designed using a client-server architecture.  User interaction is via a graphical interface running in a web browser using Adobe Flash.  This interface communicates with a web server that also provides access to backend storage, a reasoning engine, an ontology search service and the !PubMed publication database.

== External Components ==

  * [http://www.persvr.org/Page/Persevere Persevere storage engine].  Used to store experiment designs and data.
  * [http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/PowerLoom/ PowerLoom reasoning engine].  Used to support specific interpretations of data.  This requires a customized interface and domain model.
  * [http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms/ BAMS]. Source of the brain atlas information used for reasoning by the !PowerLoom system.  Primarily used for part-of reasoning over brain regions.
  * [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ NCBO BioPortal]. Used for looking up ontology terms for annotation of experimental design model elements.
  * [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ PubMed].  Used to provide access to publication information and abstracts from the interpretation of data in specialized interfaces.
  * [http://lab.kapit.fr/display/kalileo/Diagrammer+v1+Developer+Guide Kapit Diagrammer].  Provides the graphical library for drawing and interacting with experimental designs.
  * [http://flare.prefuse.org/ Prefuse Flare]. Graph library for analyzing the experimental design graphs to compute variable dependencies.
  * [http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/  Jetty Web Server]. Provides the embedded stand alone web server for the !BioScholar server.
  * [http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms/ JGoodies Forms]. Layout of the stand alone server interface.
